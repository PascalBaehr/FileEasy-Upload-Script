## Requirements

TODO

## Install

1. Upload all the files to your web server.
2. The config.php in the /utils/ folder will need to be writable, and so will the /uploads/
   directory. Chmod these to 755 or 777.
3. Point your browser to the /install/ directory and follow the instructions on screen.
4. You can access the administration by pointing your browser to the /admin/ directory, the default
   username and password is "admin".

Note: DO NOT FORGET TO DELETE ANY INSTALL AND UPGRADE DIRECTORIES FROM THE SERVER AFTER INSTALLATION.

## Customisation

You can change the layout of the script by editing the files in the /utils/templates/ folder.
